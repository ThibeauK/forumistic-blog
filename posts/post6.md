# Hardware hacking, mods, tweaks 



*'Hardware Hacking: have fun while voiding your warranty'* is a book written by hacker-writer Joe Grand and Andrew *'bunnie'* Huang (foreword). Mostly populated with technological tutorials, explaining how to hack/ modify certain electronically devices. Literary interesting parts include the foreword and introduction. These illustrate hacker culture. Bunnie transfigures *'hack'* as *'An incredible good and perhaps time consuming piece of work that produces exactly what is needed... A desire to play with and understand technology, a modern manifestation of exploration and passion'* 



Andrew Huang is emblematic of the hardware culture and its origin. 
As an early participant he perceived the evolution of electronic devices’ construction.
*'I was hoping to be able to read it like a book, with all the logic gates’ part numbers gleaming 
in their fresh white silkscreen against the matte epoxy bodies of chips. What I saw instead was a closed book… 
any hope of a deeper level of understanding or hardware exploration seemed to be dashed.'*
His reaction to the new IBM PC-AT motherboard was a personal schok to read. Growing up in 2010, 
technology always possessed certain magical aura. Only to be read by the wise. Even in my current research 
it feels like an impossible task to transcribe a motherboard. Instead I learn what each components function is,
not how it was created. You could see Andrew as a technological archaeologist. 
Presenting us with ancient mechanical outlooks. Telling stories of old, wherein companies 
like Hewlett and Packard (HP) and Apple had roots in hacker communities. 
*'The Apple 1 was designed over a period of years as a hobby machine, a true product of the hacking culture.'* 
Opposite could be said about our current Apple computer, a sleek anti-right-to-repair machine. He proposes that the hacker took the logical path of least resistance, focusing less and less on hardware. Thus becoming more software oriented. Bunnie ends the foreword with a recognition of the new found social awareness in hardware hacking. *'Rather than looking at for a new product innovation, the public is looking to hardware hackers for 
the extension and liberation of existing solutions… consumers desire featureful, inexpensive products 
that deliver exactly what they need with no hidden costs or accessories required.'*
A sentence embodying current artistic movements questioning humans relation with technology. 



Joe Grand’s reading of hardware hacking feels different. Still contextualised in social politics, 
he is also aware of its artistic nature of self expression. 
*'Taking an ordinary piece of equipment and turning it into a personal work of art. Building on an existing idea to create something better… 
We end up with a unique thing that we can call our own — imagined in our minds and crafted through hours, 
days or years of effort.'* 
For him it's about the individual effort, like creating a piece of art. 
Hacking is not a specific act. It could embody anything relating to the exploration of technology.

Philosophy of most hardware hackers:
- Do something with a piece of hardware that has never been done before.\n
- Create something extraordinary.\n
- Harm nobody in the process.\n

In the beginning of this research I envisioned myself taking apart motherboards. 
Reusing their parts for my new machines. Instead I stumbled upon the world of single board computers 
such as the raspberry Pi. A perfect instrument for creating single purpose tools due to their high performance 
and compact nature. Sadly these boards did not fulfil my previously envisioned hacking fantasy. 
I felt like a kid stacking blocks instead of a c00l hacker ripping apart machines. 
Grands contextualisation of hacking is what gave me my new found confidence. 
Reassuring me to not feel like a n00b in this vast technological field.
