# Graphic design's computing tool 1



Researching the origins of graphic design and the computer becomes an essential task to comprehend their symbiotic relationship. Like other disciplines styles have been used to pigeonhole works in genres, determining their historical origins. While investigating it became evident that the utilization of styles was unsuccessful. Books such as Graphic Design: A New History <a href="https://archive.org/details/graphicdesignnew00eski/page/n9/mode/2up" target=“_blank”>[6]</a> by Stephen J. Eskilson mention the revolution computing technology brought to the industry. Elaborating with artistic forms created during the rapid development of electronic devices. Failing to perceive how the machines’ hardware impacted stylistic choices. Through categorizing works according to the computing tools that facilitated their creation, the influence of the equipment begins to emerge.

*'From the perspective of the history of technologies, then it is less helpful to see innovations as having linear histories, moving in a trajectory towards stabilisation, than it to observe how technologies and movements wane and revive in cycles and there relations to other technologies and practices.'* <a href="https://www.berghahnbooks.com/downloads/intros/OldenzielCycling_intro.pdf" target=“_blank”>[7]</a>

-Ruth Oldenziel & Helmuth Trishler  

The designer has used computing tools since the late 19th century. Analog devices like Linotype and phototypesetting machines precede current electronic computers. Their usage not only producing a specific aesthetic reminiscent of the instrument. They also facilitated a kinship with their user. Workers understood their personal Linotype machines. They knew which specific *'sizzle'* would signal a molten metal spew. Enabling them to evade a physical burn. Contemporary graphic designers fail to understand their tool. Every generation, electronic devices progressively conceal their internal hardware. Examplified by current generation MacBooks which infuse their battery to the upper part of the case. *'A battery replacement has transformed into a removal of every component.'* <a href="https://nl.ifixit.com/News/64072/apples-self-repair-program-manages-to-make-macbooks-seem-less-repairable" target=“_blank”>[8]</a>
