# Replying; Tips & Tricks.
Hey everybody ( •̤ᴗ• )੭⁾⁾ 
I found this blog post <a href="https://blogsaverroes.juntadeandalucia.es/roadtoenglishc1/2020/02/18/writing-a-forum-post-useful-tips/" target="_blank">[1]</a> giving tips on how to reply. Maybe it could come in handy for some readers.


1. Start writing Posted by+ nickname + on date + time, unless you are given that information or part of that information.  
e.g. Posted by thehapytraveller on 23th Oct, 2018 18:00pm

2. Regarding greetings, try to use informal ones 


3. This is the body of the forum reply. Make meaningful conversation. Responding to a post gives you the ability to expand the conversation  


4. You can close your forum post with a useful expression + the nickname/name of the person you are replying to and your own name or nickname. This part is sometimes omitted in real forum posts. Nevertheless, I recommend you include it. 
e.g. Have a nice day, bohemian!
		Bob 


5. Use informal language, but precise. 


6. Use short paragraphs and spaces between each paragraph.

7. (My Tip) If you want to open the research through aiding links. Comment them like this. 
`<a href="LINK"> LINK AGAIN </a>`
This process makes the link clickable.
