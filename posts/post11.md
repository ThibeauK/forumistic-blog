# What's an unfinished stairway?
Exploring ones computing machine is a terrifying practice. Digital producers bear an internal fear of damaging their electronic tools. The destruction of their personal device leads to the destruction of their artistic practice. Technological anxiety is bestowed in many of us. Instituted by corporations producing unhackable devices. Constructing an unsustainable loop of consumers obtaining *'technological advancements'*. Yet the physical examination of ones device causes the user to establish critical technological awareness. Visualising the users conceptual opposition to the computing manufacturers. Reclaiming the establishments hardware facilitates a sustainable digital practice. The designer positions themself as a hardware gatherer. Electornic fruits utilised in the assembly of a personal computional graphic machine. 



Developing critical comprehension of ones hardware usage, visualizes the disconnect between electronic tool and artistic functions. Our creative practice does not demand such overly powerful computing devices. Consumers must reshape their personal graphic tools. Minimising the imbalance between their desires and one standardised technology. Minimal computing proposes designers to rethink their computational needs. <a href=https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/> *'The User, the Leaner, and the machines We Make'* </a> written by Alex Gil aims to comprehend hardware creation build upon *'the architectures of necessity'*. A term conceptualised by designer Ernesto Oroza. Clarified through a personal narrative: 



*'He lived with his mother in a space that was so small that it couldn’t legally be considered a house. He expanded into the hallway, built a kitchen and refurbished the bathroom. He changed the status of the property and acquired a title for it. He got his hands on a permit to build on the roof, as he thought about moving out on his own. In order to do this he had to build an exterior stairway. He set to work on the structure indoors and started the paperwork to divide the property. The appearance of an exterior stairway before the process of dividing the houses was finished could be considered a violation, and he could be fined or even lose all property rights to the house he had built.* 


*He understood that the description of the house and its parts depends on the cultural understanding that we have of it, that laws depend on this understanding. Then, what is a stairway. How does one describe it? Could he build a structure in front of his doorway that looks nothing like a stairway but serves the same function. Maybe just objects stacked in such a way that one can climb and descend them? Or an object by Ettore Sottsass, a stack that includes all of Feijóo’s books, a Franz West sculpture, anything?*
 

*He decided on a conceptual shortcut: he build the stairway and waited to be fined. In this way, he gained time. The Law demanded that he cease building the stairway until the paperwork needed to divide the property was finalised.* 


*Years went by. He used the unfinished stairway.* 


*What’s an unfinished stairway?'*



Questioning our computational needs as designers removes us from the inevitable technological advancing loop. It invites us to reshape the sleek all-en composing tools facilitating our artistic practice. Our digital methodology is not universal. Yet, virtually all Western graphic designers exclusively rely on proprietary MAC-OS machines. The creation of designer-specific computers fosters a greater technological comprehension. Facilitating a digital space to propose critical questions and practices.
