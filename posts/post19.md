# Provisional conclusion 


Concluding this technological research transforms its open-ended structure into static media, severing it from internal critical motivations. Unable to formulate stationary resolutions, I present current technological verdicts as a provisional conclusion. I encourage my future self to update **forumistic.blog**’s digital inquiry. Linear narratives are deceptive of critical technological awareness. Ceaseless experimental frameworks allow users to critique ever-changing technological structures. Rather than a thesis, this technological inquiry was written as the digital materialisation of sporadic thinking. Its irregular nature shaped a distinct writing style. Blog posts are populated with small sentences and technological narratives, influenced by preceding entries and physical research. Textual categorisation contradicts **forumistic.blog**’s organic development. Computational reflection is a framework enabling unsystematic codification.



This website embraces multiple narratives. Digital exploration is feasible through the chronological ruleset of the blog, enforcing the user to read **bottom up**. The <a href=#comments-container>comments-container</a> fabricates new post-chronologies. Replying to digital updates enables the user to gain further insight. Personal interest empowers readers to pursue corresponding texts. I want to propose one last narration. A notion that highlights the inquiry’s influence on personal computational development. **Forumistic.blog**’s physical vessel materialises critical technological research. <a href="#post-post3">[post3]</a> and <a href="#post-post11">[post11]</a> stimulated the development of this single-purpose device. Fostering skeptical reflections on computational necessity established a minimalist machine. Its functionality includes: writing, publishing and digital research. The latter has transformed into a slow practice. Thoughtful key presses have replaced rapid typing. Digital publishing was executed through the device’s console. Commands enabled me to post technological research sustained upon minimalist hardware. The website’s design reflects this technical methodology.

<a href="#post-post5">[post5]</a>, <a href="#post-post7">[post7]</a> and <a href="#post-post9">[post9]</a> established the designer’s contemporary computer. Illustrating unsustainable devices incapable of critical technological awareness. These demonstrate mechanical challenges my single purpose device must overcome. Hardware hacking tactics empower critical narratives <a href="#post-post10">[post10]</a>. One academic year did not give me enough technological insight to comprehend indecipherable components. <a href="#post-post6">[post6]</a> and <a href="#post-post17">[post17]</a> reassured this personal technological unfamiliarity. The comprehension that observing technology is still a form of hacking encouraged me to use single-board computers. <a href="#post-post16">[post16]</a> exemplifies how hardware modification can adhere to computerised consumerism. <a href="#post-post13">[post13]</a>, <a href="#post-post14">[post14]</a> and <a href="#post-post15">[post15]</a> highlights sustainable alternatives in the ethics of personal engineering. Inspiring me to develop a DIY machine without western entrepreneurial habits. 



This technological inquiry’s single-purpose computer is sustained by salvaged hardware and preconceived through natural elements. A Raspberry Pi 3B+ facilitates the device’s computing capabilities. Reminiscent of historical computational wedges the machine’s body exhibits keyboard characteristics. Its transparent enclosure reveals internal components, empowering the user to comprehend internal mechanisms. 

Components include:

-    Second hand Raspberry Pi 3B+

-    Salvaged power source <a href="post-post8">[post8]</a>

-    Camera component optimised with USB protocol <a href="post-post12">[post12]</a>

-    Recycled external LCD Display 

-    Flexible keyboard circuit 

-    Silicone chassis <a href="post-post18">[post18]</a>

This technological research is not a technical manifesto. It is a practical and digital manifestation of an attempt to understand computing technology. I do not condemn the reader for using systemised computers. Nor do I despise contemporary machines. **Forumistic.blog** and its computational vessel are a critical expression against current engineering structures. Its goal is to make the reader aware of their personal technological history <a href="#post-post4">[post4]</a>. Assisting them to foster sustainable digital practices.
