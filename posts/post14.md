# Technological gambiarra 



Dao-engineering proves the usefulness of diverse technological reasoning. Brazil’s cultural practices visualises electronics unsustainable habits. The thesis *Gambiarra: repair culture* <a href="https://www.makery.info/en/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/">[21]</a> frames the creation of *MetaReciclagem*. Previously quoted in <a href="#post-post12">post12</a>, co-founder Felipe Fonseca illustrates the networks origins and disapproval of Western entrepreneurial habits. In 2002, the group of electronics hobbyists primarily discussed ideals. Eventually leading to the creation of the Brazilian collective. Their practice originated as the exploration of discarded computational machines. Altering their internal functioning with the assistance of open source software. Evolving into a loose network sustaining technological methodologies. Advocating for critical appropriation of technologies on behalf of socialistic change. 



Their actions are rooted in Brazilian ideals such as gambiarra. *Gambiarra refers to all kinds of improvised solutions to concrete problems that appear when one doesn’t have access to the proper tools, materials, parts or specific knowledge to perform a given task. It is all about repairing or re-purposing objects that seemed to be little use but end up acquiring new value of tactic, applied creativity.* Ideals of **everyday innovation** fuel their repurposing actions. Opposite to Western practices maintaining uneven distribution and the enclosure of technological knowledge. This imbalance visualises the distinction between electronic necessity and Western curiosity. Brimming with commercial designers-to-be forging plastic prototypes. 



Felipe Fonseca senses the dissapearance of hackers longing to be electronic carpenters. Replaced by entrepreneurial geeks praising their Google Drive spreadsheets. This behaviour supports the central role of commercial operations. Visible in the usage of proprietary operating systems found on maker space machines. *Prototypes are to an extent the opposition of the Brazilian gambiarra. These are not an object on their own, rather a rehearsal of a finalised product. Waiting to be mass produced. Implying their wasteful nature.*



Gambiara engineering discovers multiple solutions. Re-purposing various electronic objects to perform task not previously foreseen. For them repair culture is not merely about the physical act of extending an objects life time or altering their functions. It embodies a technological protest against the modification of creativity into commodity.
