# Frictional machines



https://designingfriction.com <a href="https://designingfriction.com" target=“_blank”>[4]</a> is a text written by artist Luna Maurer, Roel Wouters and co author Alexandra Barancová. It speaks about one element that disappears when 
designing with digital tools. Friction. Due to all-encompassing actions like the swipe, left click, right click, zoom etc. that are being repurposed for alternating functions. 
These new computational devices are feature-rich but their forms stay identical. Sleek frictionless slabs (horizontal or vertical) losing their autonomy.
The website proposes to embrace this friction again. *With friction we get immersed, we get creative.* It visualises what 'designing friction' could entail: discomfort, time delay, engagement of the body, 
non positive. The phrase *Do something strange.* enclosing their anti-smooth manifesto. 



As a graphic designer I plea for these frictional machines. This loathing I feel against our new smooth technology is what energises my research. All-encompassing devices don't create interesting forms. They struggle.
In the same vein of a kid combining all the paints expecting a beautifull rainbow. Instead creating a brown stain. A technological device with a smaller toolbox could more simply express their purpose.
The question becoming not why but how a machine could succeed in parading its internal function as an external aesthetic.
