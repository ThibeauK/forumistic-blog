# Western linear sustainability



Contemporary design practices are categorised by the consumers mass-usage of technology. Our current **Age of Great Acceleration** <a href="https://www.berghahnbooks.com/downloads/intros/OldenzielCycling_intro.pdf"> [7] </a> fosters the glorification of technological advancement build upon the **success** of post-colonialism. Western designers are ingrained with a linear perspective of sustainability. Its terminology constructed in the virtue of natures commodification. Hans Carl van Carlowitz’s *Sylvicultura Oeconomica* critiques deforestation. Preaching to refrain ourself from extracting more wood than able to regrow. Sustainable strategies are utilised to combat the destruction of his precious resource. <a href="https://www.berghahnbooks.com/downloads/intros/OldenzielCycling_intro.pdf"> [7] </a>


Technological sustainability has been evangelised in Western communities. Largely populated with fab-labs and maker spaces commodifying alternative solutions. Producing plastic knickknacks hoping to accomplish monetary gain. Entrepreneurial narratives around DIY tinkering fail to comprehend its historical cultural narrative. Their digitital methods are rooted in Western linear perspectives. Unable to glorify hands-on material practices due to their reliance on technological advanced machinery. 



Comprehending the potential of a cyclical sustainability provides us with global technological perspectives. We must reconfigure our dominant colonising models of technology. Emphasising their relation between designer, consumer and meaning-making. *Repair culture is not a mere life effect of the development of industrial societies. It is one of the very few distributed and consistent niches of resistance against the transformation of all human creativity into quantifiable commodity.* <a href="https://www.makery.info/en/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/" target=“_blank”>[21]</a> Technological history is not a universal perspective. Other nations have manifested technology differently. Fostering a multidimensional future eliminates the need for western societies constant material flow. Sustainable alternatives becomes conceivable through techno-diversity.
