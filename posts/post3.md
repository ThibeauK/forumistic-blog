# Blog vs Forum



During the early development of this page multiple aliases were used: forum-wiki, thesis-forum, blog-wiki. Unclear of their respective meaning, I used them as an entry point into my research. The first step after the websites creation was to define it. The page https://www.teaching.unsw.edu.au/assessment-blog-wiki-or-forum-which-should-you-use compares the forum, blog and wiki. It’s clear that the term wiki does not fit the created framework. Classification becomes a comparison between blog and forum. 



*Definition*

*Teaching.unsw defines the blog as online journal, diary or news column with posts in reverse-chronological order (latest first) and options for readers to comment. The forum is explained as a noticeboard or message board where people start new topics or discussions and respond to existing ones.* 


*Uses*

*Its usage being that of publishing and reflecting on work; seeking external opinions and comments; analytical writing; discussion with experts: networking. While the forum serves as a help facility hosting online asynchronous tutorials; presenting and seeking comments on analytical writing and reflection; soliciting student feedback on a course; exploring views/ opinions on a topic or idea.* 



*Ownership, authors*

*The blog is owned by an individual. It can have a single author or multiple contributors. These contributors are found in the comment section. Forums are owned by administrator/s who may moderate content. Multiple authors contribute to their own or others’ discussion threads.* 


*Timeline*

*The chronological order of the blog posts and comments is important for following an emerging narrative or keeping posts in the context of changing circumstances. (Such as external events) A chronological order of posting to the forum, or chronologically within a thread, which makes it easier to follow the conversation.* <br>

I don’t want this site's only purpose to be a reflection of my ideals, research. I intend to work towards an outcome that encompasses both my interests and that of the user. Its main narrative comes from the #posts-container using the chronological ruleset of the blog. The comment section creating a new post-chronology, reading can be done by clicking *'replying to…'*  A place both as an extension and opposition for one specific context. It invites you to reply with interesting references but it also urges other perspectives to be included. Conclusively I dismissed the personal urge to put this web-based research into a one termed box. This webpage is by definition a blog. But in comparison to that of the forum, elements of the latter peak through. Ending its classification in a blog with forumistic tendencies.
