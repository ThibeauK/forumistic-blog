# Replying; Tips & Tricks.
Hey everybody ( •̤ᴗ• )੭⁾⁾ 


I have found this great blog post online giving some tips on how to reply to stuff like blog posts. 

I thought it could come in handy for some users.


Rule 1: Start writing Posted by+ nickname + on date + time, unless you are given that information or part of that information.  

	e.g. Posted by: thehappytraveller on 23th Oct, 2018, 18:00pm

Rule 2: Regarding greetings, try to use informal ones 


Rule 3: This is the body of the forum reply. Make meaningful conversation. Responding to a post gives you the ability to expand the conversation  


Rule 4. You can close your forum post with a useful expression + the nickname/name of the person you are replying to and your own name or nickname. This part is sometimes omitted in real forum posts. Nevertheless, I recommend you include it. 

	e.g. Have a nice day, bohemian!

Rule 5: Use informal language, but precise. 


Rule 6: Use short paragraphs and spaces between each paragraph.
