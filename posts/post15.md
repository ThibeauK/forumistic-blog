# Portable customisability



The act of modifying ones computing device is not an unusual concept. Most desktop computers have the ability to be upgraded, repaired, customised, etc. These machines evolved alongside societies innovational addiction. Contemporary pc modders are interested in high frame frequency and decorative RGB. Their hyper consumption sustained by computerised consumerism. Computational users craved electronic portability. Gaining the ability to physically relocate digital spaces. Disconnecting themselves from specific computational rooms. The creation of portable computing devices deletes customisability. The mere concept roots itself in science-fiction. 



Cyberdecks introduced me to the notion of hardware hacking. Obtaining their historical origins through a reddit comment. *'The cyberdeck concept came about when personal computers were still almost exclusively desktops. A very common style at the time (late-70s to early-80s) was a wedge where the computer and keyboard were merged. Apple II, Commodore VIC-20/64/128, Atari, Coco, TRS-80, etc. There were many computer makers trying to figure out the best way to do a fully portable computer and the designs of the time reflect many different ideas and goals. The classic clamshell laptop wasn't really available until 83-84 and wasn't made by major manufacturers until around 1985. Before then there were many styles of portable computer and that's also when a lot of classic cyberpunk fiction was written. The idea was that a hacker would take these strange designs and improve them in interesting ways and that's reflected in a lot of the designs people are making.'* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/comments/cokzb6/what_is_a_cyberdeck_whats_the_difference_between/" target="_blank"> [24] </a> Fictional cyberpunk aesthetics intrigued me. Becoming fascinated by their reflection of internal functions as external embellishments. Browsing YouTube for computer engineering tutorials. Hobbyist inventing their personal portable devices. Conceptually motivating my personal technological inquiry. 



Digital libraries visualised cyberdeckâ€™s connection with computerised consumers. Blogs listed amazon affiliate shopping links. Promoting the appropriation of small components to sustain portable fantasies. Minimalist computing emerged as a byproduct. Visualising the movement lack of sustainable technological reflection.
