# Portable customisability


Desktop systems have disappeared due to the standardisation of portability. Processing the term *‘computer’* conceives a mental image of clamshell tools. This technological evolution of computerised devices killed personalisation. Electronic customisation is precent in stationary devices. Contemporary PC modders have access to unlimited components. Yet, they focus on computerised consumerism, accompanied by high frame rate and kitsch RGB embellishments. Portable computers use stickers to flaunt personal style, unable to gloat with expensive external components. Their shell is merged with electronic organs. Ripping apart their encasing kills the original device. 


Conceptually, personalised portability blends itself with science-fiction. It envisions hackers generating computational bracelets to obtain government secrets. Fictional cyberpunk machines introduced me to notion of hardware hacking. Scrolling r/cyberDeck shaped the early stages of this technological inquiry. *'The cyberdeck concept came about when personal computers were still almost exclusively desktops. A very common style at the time (late-70s to early-80s) was a wedge where the computer and keyboard were merged. Apple II, Commodore VIC-20/64/128, Atari, Coco, TRS-80, etc. There were many computer makers trying to figure out the best way to do a fully portable computer and the designs of the time reflect many different ideas and goals. The classic clamshell laptop wasn't really available until 83-84 and wasn't made by major manufacturers until around 1985. Before then there were many styles of portable computer and that's also when a lot of classic cyberpunk fiction was written. The idea was that a hacker would take these strange designs and improve them in interesting ways and that's reflected in a lot of the designs people are making.'* <br>

Fictional cyberpunk aesthetics intrigued me, fascinated by their reflection of internal functions as external embellishments. Browsing YouTube for engineering tutorials showcased hobbyist inventing personalised portable devices. These cyberdeck projects displayed attachments to computerised consumers. Forums referred amazon affiliate links, promoting the appropriation of small components to sustain electronic fantasies. Minimalist computing emerged as a byproduct, not a computational goal. Visualising the movement lack of sustainable technological reflection.
