# Tutorial: clay computer



One critique I appointed against contemporary clamshell devices was their sleek aesthetics. These represent false promises of limitless innovation. Highlighting computational technology's inability to shape-shift into distinct functional forms. Practicing DIY computerised customisation breaks designer's connection with consumerist engineering. The re-glorification of hands-on traditions coupled with salvaged hardware materialises sustainable devices critical of their own technological nature.



In addition to computer's exploitation of rare minerals, electronic devices employ ingredients like plastic and metal to cloak their unsustainable hardware. Practices such as *'feminist hardware: making printed circuit boards with natural clay'* [28] and *'https://simplifier.neocities.org/materials'* [29] employ natural materials to critique technologies' foundation. Their actions inspired me to limit usage of discardable matters. Settling on local clay to shape my single-purpose device. Hands on manipulation has replaced previous digital designing. 



Materials used: 


- clay 


- tap water 


- trashed cardboard 


- clingfilm 


- roller guides 


- slab roller 





Determining the computer's shape was difficult. I was unable to envision a hyper stylised device. Yet, I  pictured a framework detached from minimalist sleekness, ultimately shaping the device around its internal components. Producing a rectangular machine reminiscent of early computational wedges. 



First, sketch the dimensions of your device. I used old cardboard to design a speculative model. 



1. Shape to personal desire. 





Molding damp clay makes it difficult to shape sturdy structures like walls. Controlling the material Is easier in a leather dry state.
An ideal consistency that no longer warps when held but is malleable with enough effort. [30] A flat clay slab allows it to reach this dehydrated condition. Thickness of slab is based on manifested device. (In this instance I used a thickness of 0.7cm) 



Roller guides refrain you from flattening the clay too much and prevents uneven manipulation. I employed commercial wooden guides but any same sized tall object works. 



1. Release air bubbles by shaping clay into firm rectangle.


2. Place clay onto non-sticking material. I chose clingfilm but fabric is the most absorbent surface. 


3. Flatten rectangle with hand.


4. Roll out clay object until it becomes flat slab. Shift orientation if clay reaches guides. Rotating allows the form to stretch in multiple directions. 


5. Place another non-sticking material on top of the clay. Lift up sandwiched slab by placing one hand underneath. Flip over object. (Avoids clinging to clingfilm.) 


6. Wrap clay slab in clingfilm. (To achieve leather dry state let the object rest for one day.) 


7. Open up clay film package when the time arrises. (Dry until specific humid is reached.) 





Manipulating clay freehandedly creates unpredictable shapes. This inconsistency is unusable for computational designs wherein sizing is specified to internal hardware. The cardboard speculative model forms a foreseeable structure. Utilising its negative space as a stencil. 



1. Place cardboard stencil on clay slab. 


2. Cut out structures. (Cut straight down so wall edges are not crooked.) 


Modelling a three dimensional shell proposes the employment of multiple clay parts. Individual walls are still separated from the large foundational slab. Water gives clay its adhesive ability, enabling the creation of an unified object. 



1. Apply parallel scratches to both component\'92s contact point. 


2. Moisturise connection spot with water. 


3. Adhere pieces together. 


4. Smooth out contact mark till no longer visible. 


I want to underline my personal hypocrisy in this practical inquiry. The computational device is an artistic endeavour developed to visualise and critique technology's employment. Its figurative form must reflect experimentation and investigation. The user should be capable of observing the machine's inner-workings. Distancing myself from plastic and metal enabled me to design with natural materials. Sadly, transparent clay is nonexistent. Along with a desire to foster a sticky, anti-sleek device I decided on using transparent silicone to finalise the computer's form.
