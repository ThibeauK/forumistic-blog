# A personal technogical history



<p><a href="#image-bibliography">[I]</a><img src="images/post4-1"></p>
Defining technology in our current innovation addicted society is an important task. In *A rant about technology* <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-rant-about-technology" target=“_blank”>[3]</a> Ursula K. Le Guin frames it as the active human interference with the material world. Further elaborating that *We have been decentralised by a hundred and fifty years of ceaselessly expanding technical prowess that we think nothing less complex and showy than a computer or a jet bomber deserves to be called technology.* Grasping this is an important task to use futuristic terminology. I will elaborate more about the digital devices that Le Guin illustrates in the latter of her sentence, the computer. This electronic machine has been the biggest technological factor in sculpting my personality. It has been my source of entertainment, a designing toolbox, an online hub for friends, etc. On my fifth birthday my uncle gave me my first computer. A plastic kid friendly clamshell laptop. A device created for children to apprehend the machine destined to forever have a presence in their life. Getting familiar with its internal layout and external navigational components. 



Learning was fun but as a child I wanted to do more than play the pre-programmed games. I had learned how to surf the World Wide Web using my fathers desktop computer. Yet I desired a personal computing machine that could entangle with my personality. In 2010 my wish was granted. I obtained a HP notebook. Even then it already felt like an electronic Pandora's box. I had opened something infinite. An object truly magical and incomprehensible to the normal human being. Yet also limiting due to its budget friendly hardware. Browsing through the rest of my technological history, it becomes clear that every new device obtained was motivated by a need for innovation. New functions demanded better processing. I upgraded my notebook to a bigger HP laptop. 



In early 2015 there was a shift in my academic career. Learning Graphic Design demanded more computational power. The school advised me to get a MacBook. That is what I did. This personal computing device has been broken many times. The right speaker gave out, the battery has malfunctioned, memory has been lost, it has disconnected itself from the world due to the Wifi chip corroding. Yet all my creative output has since been produced solely on this electronic device. We have a reliance on each other. Our symbiotic relationship build on a decade of graphic design and the tool which houses its creation. Recently I started sustaining its internal hardware system myself. A task previously bestowed upon electronic experts. An endeavour that has given me great insight on how my tool internally works. Clearing the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) fog that Apple has put in place.
