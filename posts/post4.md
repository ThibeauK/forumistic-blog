# Frictional machines



https://designingfriction.com is a text written by artist Luna Maurer, Roel Wouters and co author Alexandra Barancov√°. It speaks on one element that disappears when 
designing with digital tools. Friction. Due to the all-encompassing actions like the swipe, left click, right click, zoom etc. thate are being repurposed for alternating functions. 
These new technological devices are feature-rich but there forms stay identical. Sleek frictionless slabs (horizontal or vertical) losing their autonomy.
The website proposes to embrace this friction again. 'With friction we get immersed, we get creative.' It visualizes what 'designing friction' could entail: discomfort, time delay, engagement of the body, 
non positive. The phrase 'Do something strange.' enclosing their anti-smooth manifesto. 



As a graphic designer I plea for these frictional machines. This loathing I feel against our new smooth technology is what energizes my research. All-econmpassing devices don't create interesting forms. They struggle.
In the same vein of a kid combining all the paints expecting a beautifull rainbow. Instead creating a brown stane. A technological device with a smaller toolbox could more simply express their purpose.
The question becoming not why but how a machine could succeed in parading its internal function as an external aesthetic.
