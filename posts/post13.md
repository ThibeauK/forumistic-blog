# Dao-engineering 



Transcending Western technology facilitates the discovery of critical practices such as Dao-engineering. A single blog post fails to summarise Chinese Daoist life teachings. Therefore, the following paragraphs highlights their critical relation with the machine. ‘A Dao of technology?’ written by Barry Allen deletes pre-established anti-technological animosity intertwined with Daoistic believes. Exemplified by the usage of technology in their society. Nearly all Chinese households employed labor-saving-devices. Yet, these did not enable an irregular equilibrium. Technological instability is produced by the ethics of engineering, not machines.



Chapter 12 of the Zhuangzi illustrates an encounter between Kong’s discipline Zigong and an old man watering his vegetables;



*'There is a machine for this sort of thing,’ said Zigong. 'In one day it can water a hundred fields, demanding very little effort and producing excellent results. Wouldn’t you like one?'*



*…*



*The gardener flushed with anger and then said with a laugh, 'I’ve heard my teacher say, where there are machines, there are bound to be machine worries; where there are machine worries, there are bound to be machine hearts. With a machine heart in your breast, you’ve spoiled what was pure and simple, and without the pure and simple, the life of the spirit knows no rest. Where the life of the spirit knows no rest, the Way will cease to buoy you up. It’s not that I don’t know about your machine—I would be ashamed to use it!'* 



*Zigong blushed with chagrin, looked down, and made no reply.*    



The old man embodies questions around machine-necessity. Finding embarrassment in their usage. Fundamentally, we need to distinguishing technologies enforcement as essential or an act of comfortability. Mechanical tactics substitute artificial structures of know reliability. Comparable to computational devices enforcing the production of digital safety nets. Electronic tool boxes disconnect us from pure and simple design. Their infinite options facilities the creation of restless minds. Digital designers reliance on computational machines confesses their detachment from the art of dao . *'Constructed, mechanical, technological artefacts always come too late, when things are in a resting phase, requiring excessive force to move them. The better people are at this (fluid, flexible and easy), the less use the will have for artless mechanical contrivances.'*



Obtaining water without the usage of technology is a feasible task. Yet, Zigong’s follower proclaimed that the machines utilisation improves irrigation. The old man questions the tools comfortability. Stating that their usage implies the presence of consumerist tactics. Equivalent to graphic design’s entrepreneurial habits upholding the exploitation of computational machines. Hardware hacking breaks pre-established comfortability. Evidently, disconnecting the user from capitalistic structures. 



*'Alternative to engineering held hostage to despotic ideas about efficiency and profit. Not all technology is the same. Some may be coercive and unbalanced, some more generous and sage-like.'* Daoism does not condemn machines for their problematic nature. These tools are build upon the fondness of confused disordered knowledge, forging unsustainable thinking. Sage-like processing follows the nature of things. Opposing contemporary machines distorting their environment. Their knowledge achieves great effectiveness without the need for expenditure. Nature-like behaviour encourages spontaneous and harmonious efficiency. Condemning computational devices focused on effectiveness. 



*'Wu wei effectiveness comes into view as a principle that is not specifically Chinese; it belongs to the world history of techniques and design, having been discerned early and independently in the autochthonous traditions of world art and technology. Design works best when it does not seem to be working at all, and it does not seem tho be working when it seems to work like nature, despite obvious artifice. The best designed artificers never look like nature. Everyone can plainly see that they are artefacts.'*
