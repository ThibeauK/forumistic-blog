# Graphic design's computing tool 2



*'Faster memory and better screens facilitated real-time interactivity turning the computer into a device with which one played - a welcome contrast to the early days of computing, when programmers had to manually feed their instructions via punch cards and then wait hours or days for the result.    - Tina Rivers Ryan'*



Early instances of graphic design established upon home computers indicate a child-like playfulness. Compelled to experiment with their new computational toys. Works facilitated experiments attempting to comprehend the unfamiliar computing device. Their foundation build on a need for self reliance. Separating their dependency from technicians and machines stationed in laboratories. April Greiman was among the earliest artists to accept the new digital tool as an evolution of her practice. *'Greiman saw the computer in a utopian light, believing that it would lead to an age of expanded creativity that would permeate human consciousness. Along these lines, she did not view the computer as simply a functional tool with which to execute a preconceived idea but as something that had led her to experience in a way that opened up new avenues of serendipitous design.'* She visualized home computing as a conceptual magic slate. Producing new opportunities for the future designer. These utopian technological views were sustained by counter-cultural hardware. Emerged during a time when the exchange of knowledge was a highly significant practice. Early computers were designed by hackers such as the Homebrew Computer Club. Electronic enthusiasts who gathered to trade parts, circuits, and information pertaining to DIY construction of personal computing devices. 



Graphic design has transformed in relation to the computers hardware. Digital designs emit a reflection of humans rapid technological advancements. Works have turned themselves against the experimental art from before. Untranscribable machines have replaced the past hackable devices. Contemporary artist are stuck in an endless loop of cleanliness embodied by our sleek device. Becoming more clueless off their function. Are there any more rules to break in our digital design facility? 



Website design serves as a contemporary example of the computing machine’s influence on design. It is a practice fundamentally established upon it. *'From the beginning site design had to match technology. As technology became more advanced and website producers gained better control over what appeared in the users’ browser the design no longer was a reflection of or an adjustment to technology.'* The digital designer was able to redefine their practice. Using digital software to expose the mediums technological limitations. Consciously destroying their pragmatic infrastructure. 



Comprehending that the unlimited potential of technology does have boundaries is key to forging a healthy relationship. Reminiscent of the industrial revolution sustained by fossil fuels, designers believe the tools and software nourishing their work are limitless. Nothing is unlimited. Our digital computing tools are build upon mineral mining and an over abundant usage of power. We are inherently stuck in an unsustainable digital world. Our best bet is to rethink the computational hardware structure our artistic realm is forced to sustain from. Rather than finding solutions to sustain it.
